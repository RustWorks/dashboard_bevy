Bevy Pen Tool is a plugin that helps developers make 2D paths using 
Bezier curves. Its user interface provides functionality for 
- spawning Bezier curves
- moving end points and control points of Bezier curves
- linking individual Bezier curves to each other 
- grouping curves
- saving and loading paths as look-up tables (typically for animations and agent movement) 
- generating arbitrary 2D meshes that fill the interior of a path using the Lyon crate
- generating a mesh that follows a path like a road 
- saving meshes and roads in ".obj" format
- 
A stable version of Bevy Pen Tool should come out as a crate shortly after Bevy 0.6 shows up.
