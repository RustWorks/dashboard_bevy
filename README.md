## [Bevy Pen Tool](https://github.com/eliotbo/bevy_pen_tool)

Bevy Pen Tool is a plugin that helps developers make 2D paths using
Bezier curves. Its user interface provides functionality for

- spawning Bezier curves
- moving end points and control points of Bezier curves
- linking individual Bezier curves to each other
- grouping curves
- saving and loading paths as look-up tables \n(typically for animations and agent movement)
- generating arbitrary 2D meshes that fill the interior of a path \nusing the Lyon crate
- generating a mesh that follows a path like a road
- saving meshes and roads in ".obj" format

A stable version of Bevy Pen Tool should come out as a crate shortly after Bevy 0.6 shows up.
Here is a link to the [repo for more information](https://github.com/eliotbo/bevy_pen_tool).
